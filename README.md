# AI-Image-Caption-Bot
This deep learning web app uses Transfer Learning and an LSTM model to predict image captions. The image features are extracted using the Resnet-50 model, while the text features are extracted using embedded matrices from glove.6B.50d. Both models are combined in a decoder feed-forward neural network with softmax activation.
